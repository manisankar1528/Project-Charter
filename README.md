**Project Title**: UConn Student Retention Rate Analysis

**Problem Statement**: The need to improve the enrollment, attrition, and graduation rate of UConnâ€™s undergraduate program.

**Business Case**: Improving these rates will result in a more competent workforce, many of whom might remain in Connecticut, and better prepare students for graduate school.

**Scope**: The project will recommend better services for students to assist with academics, career guidance, and networking for graduating students, and suggest that the school offer mental health services.

**Constraints**: The project will prioritize scope over time and cost.

**Risks**: These include failure to meet the project deadline, inaccurate data, limited availability of software, poor communication within the team, and bad cost estimation.

**Objectives**: The project aims to integrate diverse datasets, identify factors influencing retention and graduation trends, develop predictive models, and formulate data-driven recommendations.

**Assumptions**: The sponsors have provided sufficient data, any additional data needed is readily available, and there are no major factors currently affecting university enrollment, attrition, or graduation rates.

**Project Costs**: The document mentions the total internal and external costs.

**Project Benefits**: The document mentions the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Break Even point, and indirect benefits.

**Dependencies**: The document lists both incoming and outgoing dependencies.
